/* NOTE
  We can't import 'antd/dist/antd.css'; directly because this will not allow us to do any
  customization. Also importing antd/dist/antd.less doesn't work because of the webpack problems
  - the javascriptEnabled option doesn't work (it seams to be deprecated).
  So, instead we copied the colors.less and theme in this repo. But then we need to regenerate
  the antd "core" and "components" style in a way they will be aware about our customization:
    sh antd-generate.sh full # for first clone
    sh antd-generate.sh # otherwise

  Everything would work much easier if we were able to import less files directly from antd
  (antd/dist/index.less), but, again - javascript processing doesn't work in less files
  with current webpack.
