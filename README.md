# Browser frontend

## Setting up

Requirements:

1. yarn >= 1.19
1. nodejs >= 10.0

For development you should install the following tools as well:

+ https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-devtools

Installation:

1. `yarn install --dev --prefer-offline`

Configuration: copy end edit the .env.example file

    cp .env.example .env
    $EDITOR .env

## Running

To start development server:

1. modify .env and set `REACT_APP_API_HOST` to your server location
1. `yarn start`

For production build use:

    yarn run build

### Set up linter hook

    cd ..
    make setup-dev

Test: Delete an import on any of the component files and test if you are able to commit.

### Checking out the code

Before checking out the code make sure your code follows all defined standards:

+ passes linting: `yarn run lint`
+ passes all tests: `yarn run test`

### CRA Scripts

Below we list CRA (Create React App) Scripts.

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.


## Customizing antd themes and variables

We can't import `antd/dist/antd.css` directly because this will not allow us to do any customization. Also importing antd/dist/antd.less doesn't work because of the webpack problems. The `javascriptEnabled` option doesn't work (it seems to be deprecated).

So, instead we copied the colors.less and theme in this repo. We need to regenerate the antd "core" and "components" style in a way they will be aware about our customization.

### Initial Setup

On first clone, use the following command to compile less files to css. It will result in two files, namely  `antd_components.css` and `antd_core.css`

    cd src/styles
    ./antd-generate.sh full

### Customization

Default imported files. Do not edit these files.

+ [default.less](src/styles/themes/default.less): This is a copy of the antd styles. Do not edit this file. Instead, use [customization.less](src/styles/themes/customization.less) for adding overwriting existing variables and adding new variables.
+ [colors.less](src/styles/colors.less): This is copied from `antd/style/color/colors.less`. It has all the antd colors.

Make your edits and overwrites to the following files.

+ [customization.less](src/styles/themes/customization.less): Add all changes to the default css vars here

To compile these changes, run the following command.

    ./antd-generate.sh


### Configure environment variables

You must create custom environment variables beginning with `REACT_APP_` and it is picked up by the node scripts. By default, it uses the mock-server api.

    cp env.example .env

## Tools and libraries we are using

## GraphQL and state

We use [urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/docs) library for GraphQL (motivation: [Urql, Grown Up](https://formidable.com/blog/2019/urql-2019/)). The state is managed by both MobX and React components:

+ MobX -- this should handle a global state (eg user, routing). Inside MobX we still use [urql outside of react components](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/docs/urql-outside-react/)
+ React components -- we use `use*` urlq [functions](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/blob/master/README.md#queries) to manage the loading and error cases. There is no need to use `Query` component wrapper and uglify the code.
+ File handling in urql: https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/issues/14

urlq itself handles cache management.


### MobX

## TIPS

+ [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet) of React types and typescript.

+ [antd recommended](https://ant.design/docs/react/recommendation) 3rd party libraries.

### Ignoring liner checks

Put the following code at the end of the line you want to ignore.

    // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars

## Current problems

+ CRA doesn't handle less scripts (less can embed JavaScript) - hence we have to prebuild antd styles.
